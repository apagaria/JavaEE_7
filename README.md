# Architecture
Java EE is a set of specifications implemented by different containers. Containers are Java EE runtime environments
that provide certain services to the components they host such as life-cycle management, dependency injection,
concurrency, and so on. These components use well-defined contracts to communicate with the Java EE
infrastructure and with the other components. They need to be packaged in a standard way (following a defined
directory structure that can be compressed into archive files) before being deployed. Java EE is a superset of the Java
SE platform, which means Java SE APIs can be used by any Java EE components.
